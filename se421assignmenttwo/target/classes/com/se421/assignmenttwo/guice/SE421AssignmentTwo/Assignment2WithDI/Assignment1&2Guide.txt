--- Assignment 2 ---

For this assignment, you are required to refactor the code submitted as part of Assignment 1 to do the following:

1: Incoperate Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern with the use of Google Guice API. DI should be utilized in all of your service classes.

2: Apply the Listener design pattern on the code submitted for Req. 7 in the original assignment 1. 

3: Make your domain object classes (books, videos, etc) immutable with the help of builder design pattern

4: Incoperate Singleton design pattern.

5: Create Java packages and allocate class to them.

Remarks:
- Work in a group of two include your names and AUIS email addresses as code comments in the source code files.
- Upload a UML class diagram for your new code base.
- Upload your project as a zip file to Moodle.

Bonus: +2 In addition to DI, provide another variant of the code base that utilizes Factory design pattern.






--- Assignment 1 ---
Work in a group of two to build a terminal application for AUIS' library office. The requirements go as follows:

1: A librarian will use your application to track the items that have been borrowed by students, staff or faculties.

2: Library materials that could be borrowed are books, videos, journals and technical papers. Each of which has a unique ID (Library ID) along with a title and a description.

3: When a student, staff member, faculty interested in borrowing an item from the library. He/she will provide her/his AUIS ID along with the library ID of the item.

4: The librarian will search for the given item via your application, then add a lend record, where the deadline for the lending ends after two weeks' time.

5: Any AUIS member can lend up to five items from the library.

6: If an item is returned after their due date, the borrower will be charged a fine, based on the type of item (books $3/day, journals $3/day, videos $1/day, technical paper $2/day). Your application should calculate the total fine for any lend and should print it to the librarian as needed.

7: With every change in the library system (i.e. an item returned or borrowed), print a table showing all the lent items along with their due dates and total fines.

Remarks:
- Work in a group of two include your names and AUIS email addresses as code comments in the source code files.
- Include CRC cards and a UML class diagram for your code base.
- Upload your project as a zip file to Moodle.
- Reduce code duplication.
- Make your code flexible. For instance, adding a new type of material should cause minimum amount of code refactoring.
- Design and code creativity is important for this assignment. The more creative you are, the higher the points you should expect.

Bonus: +2 While you are printing the table, change the font color to red for all records that have fines.
